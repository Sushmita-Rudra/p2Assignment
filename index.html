                        I am from India and have completed my under-graduation in Electronics and Communications.
                        My interest towards learning programming made me took up the job as Associate Software Engineer at Accenture, right after my under-graduation. I worked for a couple of years in a project where most of my work dealt with SQL Database Administrative activities. I have had worked on maintaining servers in Microsoft Azure as well. I like to hang-out with my friends and explore new places in my free time. I listen to music to escape from real-world chaos.
