I have recently joined in the Masters of Applied Computer Science at NWMSU.
 
I am from India and have completed my under-graduation in Electronics and Communications.
My interest towards learning programming made me took up the job as Associate Software Engineer at Accenture, right after my under-graduation. I worked for a couple of years in a project where most of my work dealt with SQL Database Administrative activities. I have had worked on maintaining servers in Microsoft Azure as well. I like to hang-out with my friends and explore new places in my free time. I listen to music to escape from real-world chaos.
 
I am passionate to learn more about Database Administration and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (ML), though I do not have any work experience related to AI/ML .After graduating from NW, I want to work as a Machine Learning Engineer. My goal is to collaborate with people to develop a software or product which is based on Human-Computer interactions and AI/ML.
